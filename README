libtimeclock (Android)

This library timestamps [1] given data (e.g., a scanned text ID [2])
and inserts them into an SQLite DB table.

Both scanned ID and timestamp are returned in a scannedData object. Also,
if scannedID is found in an optional reference data table, its data
columns are added to the object for display.

Sample Display:

    Scanned ID
    [refData col 1]
    [refData col 2]
    [refData col 2]
    Scan Date
    Scan Time

Scanned data can be searched by scannedID (text string) or date range
([from-date], [to-date]) for export to CSV format.

The library user must create a method with 2 statements:

    1. String scanID () - scan [2] and return scanned ID as a String object.

    2. scannedData clockID (String scannedID)

        appActions::clockID() creates a scannedData object with scannedID
        and current timestamp and calls:

        2.1 refData getRefData (String scannedID)

            to look up scannedID in the optional reference data table and
            return associated data in a refData object. If the refData
            object is not empty, its contents are added to scannedData.

        2.2 scannedData insertScanData (String id, scannedData sd)

            to insert scannedID, timestamp, and reference data (if found)
            into the scannedData table.

            scannedData is returned for display.

[1] Current date [yyyy/mm/dd] and time [HH:MM:SS], as 2 separate fields
[2] from Barcode/RFID/etc. scanner - scanner interface to be implemented
    by the library user. See app folder for sample code using the ZXing
    Barcode Scanner libary.
